One of our partners gave us a demographics file for the entire US population (assuming 300 million entries). Write a program that will output the content of the input file into another file in ascending order. You are welcomed to use any language and please provide the most efficient solution.

Input:

The first line gives the number of ages, N. N lines follow each contains one number contains only age information.

1 <= N <= 3000000

Output:

N lines show the ages in ascending order.
